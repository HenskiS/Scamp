# Scamp Development Progress

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-07

## Project Overview

Scamp is a Mac device topology mapper tool for planning and visualizing peripheral setups. The project consists of:
- **Mapper**: Static planning application for designing device topologies
- **Shared**: Reusable React Flow components library
- **Scanner**: (Future) Real-time device detection app for macOS

## Current Status: Mapper MVP Complete ✓

The Mapper application is feature-complete for Phase 1-8 planning tasks. All core functionality is working.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Port Directionality System
**Problem:** React Flow connections were bidirectional by default, making it unclear which device was source vs target.

**Solution:** Added `PORT_DIRECTIONS` enum with three values:
- `IN`: Renders target handle only (receives data)
- `OUT`: Renders source handle only (sends data)
- `BIDIRECTIONAL`: Renders both handles (default)

**Default Port Directions:**
- Computer ports: BIDIRECTIONAL (host can send/receive)
- Hub upstream: IN (connects to host)
- Hub downstream: OUT (connects to peripherals)
- Display input: IN, output: OUT
- USB/Thunderbolt devices: Typically IN
- Adapter input: IN, output: OUT

### Color Coding
- **USB**: Blue (#4169e1)
- **Thunderbolt**: Gold/Yellow (#f4c430)
- **Ethernet**: Green (#32cd32)
- **DisplayPort**: Purple (#9370db)
- **HDMI**: Red (#ff6347)

Colors applied to:
- Port handles (14x14px colored circles)
- Connection edges (stroke color)
- Device borders (based on primary device type)

### Drag-and-Drop Implementation
Uses native HTML5 drag-and-drop API:
1. Toolbar buttons set `draggable` attribute
2. `onDragStart` stores device type in `dataTransfer`
3. Canvas wrapper listens for `onDrop` events
4. React Flow's `screenToFlowPosition()` converts mouse coordinates to canvas position
5. Callback triggers normal device creation flow with exact drop position

## Recent Changes (2026-01-07 Evening Session)

### UI Enhancements

1. **Setup Name Input** - Added editable setup name field in header center. Name is stored in topology and persisted.
   - Files: [App.jsx](packages/mapper/src/App.jsx:238-240), [App.module.css](packages/mapper/src/App.module.css:35-66)

2. **Port Labels Toggle Relocated** - Moved from header to toolbar right section for better organization.
   - Files: [Toolbar.jsx](packages/mapper/src/components/Toolbar/Toolbar.jsx), [Toolbar.module.css](packages/mapper/src/components/Toolbar/Toolbar.module.css:55-83)

3. **Sidebar Component** - New left sidebar with tabbed interface showing:
   - Device list: Name, type, canvas, port count with expandable port details
   - Connection list: Type, label, full path with device names and ports
   - Click any item to open editor
   - Files: [Sidebar.jsx](packages/mapper/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.jsx), [Sidebar.module.css](packages/mapper/src/components/Sidebar/Sidebar.module.css)

4. **Hover Highlighting System** - Synchronized highlighting across sidebar and canvas:
   - Hover device → highlights device + all connections
   - Hover connection → highlights connection + both connected devices
   - Uses efficient state updates to avoid node recreation
   - Files: [App.jsx](packages/mapper/src/App.jsx:27-28,255-270), [TopologyCanvas.jsx](packages/shared/src/components/Canvas/TopologyCanvas.jsx:106-151)

### Visual Enhancements

5. **Port Direction Arrows** - Visual indicators on port handles using CSS pseudo-elements:
   - IN ports: arrows pointing into device (→ ← ↓ ↑)
   - OUT ports: arrows pointing out of device (← → ↑ ↓)
   - BIDIRECTIONAL: double arrows (↔ ↕)
   - Files: [DynamicDeviceNode.jsx](packages/shared/src/components/nodes/DynamicDeviceNode.jsx:109-111), [DynamicDeviceNode.module.css](packages/shared/src/components/nodes/DynamicDeviceNode.module.css:44-131)

6. **Animated Crawling Connections** - CSS animation showing data flow direction:
   - Dashed stroke pattern with `stroke-dashoffset` animation
   - Automatically flows source → target (OUT → IN)
   - GPU-accelerated, no JavaScript overhead
   - Files: [ConnectionEdge.jsx](packages/shared/src/components/edges/ConnectionEdge.jsx:47-53), [ConnectionEdge.module.css](packages/shared/src/components/edges/ConnectionEdge.module.css:45-57)

### Data & Editing Enhancements

7. **Connection Type Auto-Detection** - Now uses actual port types instead of name-based heuristics:
   - Looks up port objects by ID
   - Uses source port type, falls back to target port type
   - File: [App.jsx](packages/mapper/src/App.jsx:84-113)

8. **Manual Connection Editing** - Connection editor now allows changing endpoints:
   - Device dropdowns for source/target
   - Port dropdowns (filtered by selected device)
   - Automatically resets port selection when device changes
   - File: [ConnectionEditor.jsx](packages/mapper/src/components/ConnectionEditor/ConnectionEditor.jsx)

9. **Port Label Uniqueness Validation** - Enforces unique port labels per device:
   - Validates on save in DeviceEditor
   - Shows alert with duplicate port names
   - File: [DeviceEditor.jsx](packages/mapper/src/components/DeviceEditor/DeviceEditor.jsx:39-63)

10. **Status Messages Removed** - Cleaned up UI by removing temporary header messages:
    - All events now only appear in EventLog
    - Removed message state and setTimeout calls
    - File: [App.jsx](packages/mapper/src/App.jsx) (multiple locations)

## Previous Changes (2026-01-07 Earlier)

1. **Port Label Toggle** - Added button in header to show/hide port labels. Preference saved to localStorage.

2. **Port Directionality** - Implemented IN/OUT/BIDIRECTIONAL port types.

3. **Drag-and-Drop Device Placement** - Can now drag device buttons from toolbar onto canvas for precise positioning.

4. **Event Log Ordering** - Events now display in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

5. **Adapter Device Type** - Added new device type for converters (USB-to-Ethernet, etc.) with smaller visual footprint.
